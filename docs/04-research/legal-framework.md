# **Strategic Feasibility Report: Project Oneka AI**

To: The Auditor General, Republic of Kenya  
From: Principal Technical Advisor (Data Science, Legal Frameworks & Strategy)  
Date: November 27, 2025  
Subject: Deep Research & Strategic Risk Assessment of "Oneka AI" Decision Support System

## **1\. Executive Summary**

Verdict: Conditionally Viable with High Implementation Risk.  
Project Oneka AI represents a potentially transformative leap for the Office of the Auditor General (OAG), theoretically capable of bridging the widening chasm between our constitutional mandate and our operational capacity. However, while the system is technically feasible in specific climatological zones, it currently faces a fatal "Input Gap" due to the absence of mandatory geolocation data in the public procurement lifecycle, and a "Legal Cliff" regarding the admissibility of machine-generated satellite evidence under Section 106B of the Evidence Act. Without a simultaneous revolution in procurement policy to mandate geospatial tagging and a judicial strategy to secure evidentiary precedence, Oneka AI risks becoming a technically sophisticated engine with no fuel and no legal teeth.

## **2\. The Hard Data: Financial & Operational Imperatives**

The following metrics, rigorously extracted from the most recent Auditor General reports, national economic surveys, and parliamentary committee findings, define the "Financial Magnitude" of the problem Oneka AI seeks to solve. These figures are not merely statistics; they represent the hemorrhaging of the exchequer and the stalling of national development.

| Metric | Value | Strategic Context & Source |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Total Value of Stalled Projects** | **\~KES 304 Billion** | This figure represents the aggregate value of projects flagged as "stalled" or "delayed" across National and County governments. It is capital locked in non-performing assets, effectively a deadweight loss to the economy.1 |
| **Mega-Project Stagnation** | **KES 48.11 Billion** | **Mombasa Gate Bridge**: A single project where KES 48.11 Billion remains untouched. The project has absorbed only 2% of funds (KES 938M) over 4 years, yet continues to attract commitment fees, penalizing the taxpayer for inactivity.3 |
| **Donor Fund Efficiency** | **11% \- 61% Absorption** | Projects like the East Africa Skills Transformation Project absorbed only 61% of funds. Other donor lines show absorption as low as 11%, indicating systemic bottlenecks in execution that satellite monitoring could identify early.2 |
| **County-Level "Ghost" Risk** | **High Prevalence** | The granularity of stalled projects is severe at the devolved level: Machakos (54 projects), Nyandarua (43), Nakuru (27), Kisumu (27). These are often small works (dispensaries, classrooms) ideal for satellite verification but historically impossible to audit physically.5 |
| **Audit Window Compression** | **6 Months → 3 Months** | The **Public Finance Management Act (Sec 81(4))** reduced the reporting timeline, severely compressing the OAG's ability to physically verify assets. This legislative constraint creates a "Verification Vacuum" that only automated remote sensing can fill.1 |
| **IFMIS Data Integrity** | **"Benefits Not Realized"** | The Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) was intended to track disbursements, but the OAG reports that benefits are "yet to be fully realized" due to unsupported expenditures and a lack of linkage to physical outputs.7 |
| **Undrawn Loan Penalties** | **Multi-Billion Liability** | The government pays "commitment fees" on undrawn loan balances for stalled projects. Oneka AI’s value proposition extends beyond anti-corruption to **fiscal efficiency** by reducing debt servicing costs on dead projects.3 |

## **3\. The Financial Magnitude (The "Why")**

### **3.1 The Crisis of the "Audit Gap"**

The Office of the Auditor General (OAG) operates under a sacred constitutional mandate. Article 229 of the Constitution of Kenya compels us to confirm whether public resources have been applied "lawfully and in an effective way".1 This is a dual mandate: it is not enough to prove that the money was spent (lawfulness); we must also prove that the bridge was built, the road was paved, and the classroom exists (effectiveness).

However, the operational reality of the OAG is defined by a widening asymmetry between the volume of government activity and our capacity to inspect it. The devolution of power in 2013 multiplied our audit universe from a centralized structure to 47 county governments, each with its own assemblies, executives, and myriad project implementation committees. Suddenly, the "audit surface area" expanded exponentially, scattering thousands of small-scale infrastructure projects across Kenya's 580,367 square kilometers.

This challenge was exacerbated by a legislative constriction. As noted in the OAG's summary reports, the **Public Finance Management Act, 2012** (Section 81(4)) drastically reduced the timeline for audit reporting from the constitutional six months to a mere three months.1 This compression is catastrophic for physical verification. In a ninety-day window, auditors must review financial statements, conduct entry and exit meetings, analyze internal controls, and draft reports. The time available for "fieldwork"—the actual driving to a site in Turkana or Wajir to verify a borehole—has been squeezed to the margins.

The result is a reliance on "sampling." We verify a fraction of projects and extrapolate the findings. This statistical approach, while standard, leaves massive blind spots where "Ghost Projects" thrive. A corrupt actor knows that the probability of an auditor physically visiting a specific ECD classroom in a remote ward is statistically negligible. They can generate perfect paperwork—procurement minutes, tender awards, interim payment certificates, and completion certificates—for a building that does not exist. Without the ability to see the ground, the OAG is forced to rely on the very documents that the fraudster has forged. Oneka AI proposes to close this gap by substituting physical travel with digital ubiquity. If the satellite can visit every project, every month, the "Audit Coverage Ratio" theoretically jumps from \<5% to 100%.

### **3.2 The Stalled Project Epidemic: A Fiscal Hemorrhage**

The financial imperative for Oneka AI is driven by the sheer scale of waste locked in stalled projects. Our research indicates a conservative estimate of **KES 304 Billion** in stalled or stalled-and-delayed projects across the national and county governments.4 This is not merely "money lost"; it is "capital frozen."

Consider the **Mombasa Gate Bridge**. Launched in December 2019 with a budget of KES 49.05 billion, it was intended to be a transformative infrastructure asset. Four years later, only KES 938.2 million (2%) has been spent, leaving an untouched balance of KES 48.11 billion.3 This stagnation is not benign. The financing agreement likely includes "commitment fees"—penalties charged by the lender on the undrawn portion of the loan. We are effectively paying interest on a bridge that doesn't exist. Oneka AI could have flagged this lack of physical progress in Year 1, forcing a re-evaluation or cancellation of the loan before billions in commitment fees were accrued.

Similarly, the **East Africa Skills for Transformation and Regional Integration Project** at Meru National Polytechnic has stalled with construction works valued at KES 444 million.2 The dispute is contractual, but the result is a half-built skeleton deteriorating in the rain. At the county level, the situation is even more granular and pervasive. Machakos County alone has 54 stalled projects; Nyandarua has 43\.5 These are dispensaries, cattle dips, and market sheds—small individual values that aggregate to a massive loss of public utility.

The financial case for Oneka AI is therefore twofold. First, **Detection**: identifying "ghost projects" where money has left the Treasury (per IFMIS) but no ground broken (per Sentinel-2). Second, **Reactivation**: identifying "stalled projects" where work stopped, allowing the government to intervene, resolve disputes, and unlock the economic value of the asset. If Oneka AI can help reactivate even 1% of the stalled portfolio (KES 3 Billion), it will have paid for its development and operation for a decade.

### **3.3 The Donor Fund Disconnect**

The OAG's report on donor-funded projects reveals a systemic absorption crisis. Absorption rates hover between 11% and 61% for major projects.2 Donors release funds based on "milestones." Often, these milestones are self-reported by the implementing agency. Oneka AI offers an independent, third-party verification mechanism. By linking satellite change detection to donor disbursement triggers, the Treasury can ensure that funds are only requested when physical reality aligns with the grant agreement. This would not only reduce the incidence of ineligible expenditures (which the OAG regularly flags 2) but also build trust with development partners, potentially unlocking further financing.

## **4\. Data & Input Feasibility (The "How")**

This pillar represents the most significant strategic risk to the Oneka AI project. A satellite system is, at its core, a "coordinate-query machine." It requires two inputs to function: **Where to look** (Geolocation) and **What to look for** (Project Description/Timeline). Our deep research into the Kenyan public procurement data ecosystem reveals a catastrophic "Metadata Void" that threatens to render the system blind.

### **4.1 The Geolocation Void in Public Procurement**

The fundamental assumption of Oneka AI is that financial disbursements can be mapped to physical locations. However, a review of the **Public Procurement Information Portal (PPIP)** and standard tender practices reveals that this link is broken at the source.

We analyzed sample tender notices and the structure of the PPIP.10 The data fields typically captured include:

* **Tender Number:** e.g., KCAA/919/RFQ/0022/2025-26.  
* **Procuring Entity:** e.g., Kenya Civil Aviation Authority.  
* **Item Description:** e.g., "Procurement for Serviettes" or "Construction of Classroom."  
* **Target Group:** e.g., Women, Youth (AGPO).

Critically missing is a mandatory **Geolocation Field**. Tenders for works are rarely advertised with GPS coordinates (Latitude/Longitude). Instead, they rely on descriptive locations: *"Construction of Market Shed at X Town, approx 200m from the Chief's Camp"* or *"LR No. 209/12345"*.13

For a human auditor, these descriptions are navigable. They can call the project manager, ask for directions, or use local landmarks. For an AI system, they are meaningless. "200m from the Chief's Camp" is not a queryable geospatial dataset. Without a precise polygon or coordinate, Oneka AI cannot task the satellite. It cannot distinguish the project site from the surrounding terrain.

### **4.2 The Land Registry Quagmire: From LR to GPS**

A potential workaround would be to use the **Land Reference (LR) Number** often cited in tender documents. If we could automatically convert "LR No. 209/12345" to a GPS polygon, the system could work. However, the reality of Kenya's land information system makes this impossible at scale.

Kenya is currently in the midst of a massive, chaotic migration of land records. The Ministry of Lands is converting titles from the old registration acts (which used LR numbers) to a new regime under the **Land Registration Act, 2012**, creating new "Parcel Numbers".14 This process, driven by the *Ardhisasa* platform, is ongoing and fraught with delays.

Crucially, the digitization of the **Cadastral Map**—the master map that links numbers to physical boundaries—is incomplete.17 While *Ardhisasa* aims to digitize these records, millions of parcels exist only as paper maps in district registries. There is no API that Oneka AI can query to instantly convert an LR number to a shapefile. Furthermore, the conversion notice 14 indicates that old LR numbers are being cancelled and replaced, creating a "Metadata Fog" where a tender might reference an old number that no longer legally exists in the new register.

### **4.3 Proxy Data: The "School Code" Opportunity**

Given the lack of direct project coordinates, Oneka AI must rely on "Proxy Geolocation." The most viable proxy in the education sector is the **Ministry of Education's School Registration System**.

Research indicates that the location of schools is relatively well-mapped compared to other infrastructure. Initiatives like **Open Schools Kenya** and the World Bank's **Kenya Open Data** efforts have generated datasets containing the GPS coordinates of over 30,000 primary and secondary schools.18

If a tender is titled *"Construction of Science Lab at Moi Girls High School, Eldoret,"* Oneka AI can look up "Moi Girls High School" in the proxy database, retrieve the coordinate, and task the satellite to monitor the school compound. This "Entity-Based Geolocation" is a viable fallback for brownfield projects (additions to existing facilities).

However, this fails completely for **Greenfield Projects**. If the tender is for *"Construction of New Bypass Road"* or *"Drilling of Borehole in Wajir West"* (where no school exists), the proxy method collapses. The system remains blind to new infrastructure initiatives, which often carry the highest corruption risk precisely because they are in "nowhere."

### **4.4 The "Standard Tender Document" Policy Lever**

The solution to this data crisis lies in policy, not technology. Our review of the **Standard Tender Document for Procurement of Works** 13 identifies the exact leverage point.

Currently, **Clause 2** of the Bills of Quantities asks for a "full description where the site is situated, coordinates from the nearest known landmark".13 This is too vague. More importantly, **Clause 8** mandates a "Pre-Tender Site Visit".21 Prospective bidders must visit the site and sign a certificate.

**Strategic Recommendation:** The OAG must lobby the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) to amend the Standard Tender Document. The amendment should require that the **Site Visit Certificate** be a digital form that captures the GPS location of the site visit. Furthermore, the tender award notice uploaded to PPIP *must* include a KML/KMZ file (Google Earth polygon) of the project site. This shifts the burden of geolocation from the Auditor (who has to find it) to the Contractor/Agency (who knows where it is). Without this "Data Entry Reform," Oneka AI is non-viable.

## **5\. Technical Reality Check (The Constraints)**

The physical reality of auditing Kenyan infrastructure from space involves battling two relentless adversaries: **The Atmosphere (Clouds)** and **The Physics of Resolution**. We must stress-test Oneka AI against the specific climatology of East Africa and the limitations of the Sentinel constellation.

### **5.1 The "Two Kenyas": A Climatological Divide**

Kenya's climate creates a "Two-Speed" audit capability. The viability of optical satellite monitoring (Sentinel-2) varies drastically by region.

* **Region A: The Arid North (Viable).** In counties like **Wajir, Mandera, Garissa, and Turkana**, the climate is characterized by long dry seasons and relatively low cloud cover.23 Analysis of historical weather data for Wajir indicates that for 8-10 months of the year, optical satellites will have a clear view of the ground.23 This is a strategic advantage. These regions are the most remote, the most dangerous for physical travel (due to security risks), and the most expensive to audit. Oneka AI will perform best exactly where it is needed most.  
* **Region B: The Central Highlands & Nyanza (High Risk).** In contrast, the "breadbasket" counties—**Nyeri, Kiambu, Kericho, Kisii**—experience significant and persistent cloud cover.25 During the "Long Rains" (March-May) and "Short Rains" (October-December), and often in the cold dry season (June-July), cloud cover can exceed 80% for weeks at a time.26  
  * *Operational Impact:* An optical satellite (Sentinel-2) passes every 5 days. If it is cloudy for 4 consecutive passes (20 days), the system effectively goes blind for a month. This disrupts the ability to validate monthly interim payment certificates. You cannot tell the Treasury "stop payment" if your only evidence is a picture of a cloud.

### **5.2 The Radar Solution: Sentinel-1 to the Rescue?**

To mitigate the cloud risk in the Highlands, Oneka AI proposes using **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)** via Sentinel-1. SAR is an active sensor; it shoots microwave pulses that penetrate clouds, rain, and smoke. It measures "backscatter"—the reflection of energy back to the sensor.

* **Viability:** Sentinel-1 has a revisit time over East Africa of approximately **12 days**.28 This is sufficient for a monthly audit cycle.  
* **The "Double Bounce" Effect:** Hard, man-made structures (concrete, metal) create a distinct "double bounce" signal that is very different from the scattering of soil or vegetation.30 Theoretically, SAR can detect when a foundation is laid or a wall goes up, regardless of the weather.  
* **The Interpretation Challenge:** However, SAR is non-intuitive. It does not produce a "picture." It produces a texture map. It can tell you *something* has changed in the texture of the ground, but it cannot tell you if the contractor is using substandard bricks or if the roof is painted the wrong color. It is a "Activity Detector," not a "Quality Inspector." It is excellent for detecting "Ghost Projects" (where there is zero activity) but poor for detecting "Substandard Projects."

### **5.3 The Resolution Barrier: The "Classroom Problem"**

The most significant technical limitation is the **Spatial Resolution** of the free data.

* **Sentinel-2 (Optical):** 10 meters per pixel.31  
* **The Mathematics of Detection:** A standard Kenyan classroom (Ministry of Education norm) is approximately **10m x 20m** (200 square meters).  
* **The Pixel View:** In a 10m resolution image, a 200sqm classroom is represented by just **2 to 3 pixels**.  
* **The "Mixed Pixel" Phenomenon:** Unless the classroom aligns perfectly with the satellite's pixel grid (which it never does), the pixels will be "mixed." A pixel will contain 50% roof and 50% bare earth. The resulting spectral signature is a muddy average.32

**Implication:** Oneka AI will struggle to reliably distinguish a classroom from a small house, a community hall, or even a large rock outcrop. At 10m resolution, you can see "Built-Up Area," but you cannot definitively identify "Classroom Block A." This leads to a high rate of **False Positives** (flagging a project as missing when it's just too small to resolve) or **False Negatives** (accepting a neighbor's house as the project).

To reliably audit small county projects, the OAG would need **Sub-Meter Resolution** imagery (e.g., 50cm). This data is not free. It must be purchased from commercial providers (Maxar, Planet, Airbus). The cost—potentially thousands of dollars per square kilometer—fundamentally changes the economics of the system. Oneka AI must therefore be positioned as a "Triage Tool" for large projects (roads, dams, large institutions) or accept that it will have a "blind spot" for small vertical infrastructure.

---

## **6\. Legal & Institutional Fit (The Defense)**

Even if Oneka AI overcomes the data and technical hurdles, its output—a "Satellite Audit Report"—must survive the hostile environment of a Kenyan courtroom. When the OAG recommends prosecution for corruption based on satellite evidence, that evidence must be admissible.

### **6.1 The "Admissibility Barrier" (Section 106B)**

The **Kenyan Evidence Act (Cap 80\)** is the gatekeeper. While **Section 78A** broadly allows for the admissibility of "electronic messages and digital material," **Section 106B** introduces a critical vulnerability.33

**Section 106B(4)** requires that for electronic evidence to be admissible, it must be accompanied by a **Certificate** signed by a person occupying a responsible position in relation to the "operation of the relevant device" or the "management of the relevant activities." This certificate must confirm that the computer/device was operating properly at the time the evidence was created.33

**The Trap:** Who signs the Section 106B certificate for a Sentinel-2 image?

* The satellite is owned by the **European Space Agency (ESA)**.  
* The ground stations are in Europe.  
* The "operator" is an engineer in Darmstadt, Germany.

A Kenyan Auditor General cannot truthfully certify that they were "responsible for the operation" of the Sentinel-2 satellite. In a strict interpretation of the law—which defense attorneys for corrupt officials will absolutely pursue—the evidence could be challenged as hearsay or unauthenticated. Case law, such as *R vs. Robson & Harris* and *Njenga vs. Masitsa* 35, demonstrates that Kenyan courts often demand strict adherence to the certificate requirement to prove the integrity of the electronic record.

**The "Not My Computer" Defense:** A defense lawyer will argue: "My Lord, the prosecution has presented an image. They cannot vouch for the camera that took it. They cannot prove the satellite lens was clean. They cannot prove the transmission data was not corrupted between space and the OAG's server. Without a Section 106B certificate from the actual operator (ESA), this is inadmissible."

**Strategic Defense:** The OAG must shift the definition of the "Device." We must argue that the "computer" producing the evidence is not the satellite, but the **Oneka AI Server** that processed the raw data. The OAG officer certifies the *processing algorithm* and the *integrity of the download* from the ESA public repository, rather than the satellite itself. This is a nuanced legal argument that needs to be tested in a lower-stakes case before being relied upon in a major corruption scandal.

### **6.2 Data Protection & Privacy (The Act of 2019\)**

The **Data Protection Act (2019)** enshrines the right to privacy and regulates the processing of personal data.36

* **The Risk:** Does high-frequency satellite monitoring of a project constitute "surveillance"? If a road project passes through private land, does imaging that land violate the owner's privacy?  
* **The Defense:** Public infrastructure projects are, by definition, matters of **Public Interest**. The Act generally provides exemptions for processing data necessary for the performance of a public task (auditing). Furthermore, at 10m resolution (Sentinel-2), individuals are not identifiable. The data is "Pixelated," not "Personal."  
* **The Commercial Imagery Risk:** If the OAG upgrades to 30cm commercial imagery (where you can see a person's car or face), the privacy risk escalates significantly. At that resolution, strict Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) would be mandatory to ensure that the surveillance is proportionate to the audit goal.

### **6.3 National Security & Protected Areas**

The **Official Secrets Act** and regulations regarding "Protected Areas" prohibit photography and mapping of sensitive installations (military bases, key telecommunications nodes, State House, etc.).38

* **The Conflict:** Oneka AI is an automated "eye in the sky." If the system inadvertently monitors the construction of a military barrack or a police station (which are often funded by public money and thus audit targets), it could generate "classified" intelligence.  
* **Mitigation:** The system requires a "Geofence Blacklist." The National Security Council must provide a list of sensitive coordinates. Oneka AI must automatically "mask" or "redact" these areas from its dashboard, ensuring that uncleared auditors do not inadvertently view classified sites.

## **7\. The "Devil's Advocate" Section: The Top 3 "Kill Chains"**

If Oneka AI fails, it will not be because the AI wasn't "smart" enough. It will be because of these three specific, structural realities of the Kenyan context that interrupt the value chain.

### **Kill Chain 1: The "Garbage-In" Protocol (The Geolocation Failure)**

* **The Scenario:** Oneka AI is deployed with fanfare. The Treasury provides a data dump of 1,000 disbursements for the financial year.  
* **The Chain of Events:** The system attempts to map them. 85% of the entries list locations like "Plot 64, Kapenguria" or "Access Road near Mzee Juma's Farm." The School Proxy database finds matches for 10% of the projects. The remaining 75% are flagged as "Location Unknown."  
* **The Outcome:** The OAG auditors are presented with a dashboard that says "Unknown" for the vast majority of funds. They lose confidence in the system immediately. They return to manual sampling. The AI becomes "shelf-ware"—an expensive tool that no one uses because it requires data that doesn't exist.  
* **The Specific Root Cause:** The lack of mandatory GPS fields in the Standard Tender Document and the PPIP.

### **Kill Chain 2: The "Mabati" Confusion (The Resolution Failure)**

* **The Scenario:** A corrupt contractor is awarded KES 5 Million to build a stone-walled, tiled-roof classroom block. Instead, they build a cheap timber shed with a shiny iron sheet (*mabati*) roof, costing KES 200,000.  
* **The Chain of Events:** The Sentinel-2 satellite passes over. It sees a strong spectral signature for "Iron Roof." The "Built-Up Area Index" spikes. Oneka AI's algorithm, detecting the change from bare earth to structure, flags the project as "Verified / Progressing."  
* **The Outcome:** The system validates a fraud. The contractor is paid the full KES 5 Million for a shack. Later, a whistleblower reports the truth. The public turns on the OAG: "Your AI said it was fine\!" The credibility of the entire automated audit program is destroyed.  
* **The Specific Root Cause:** The inability of 10m resolution imagery to distinguish *quality* of materials or *permanence* of structure.

### **Kill Chain 3: The "Hearsay" Dismissal (The Legal Failure)**

* **The Scenario:** Oneka AI successfully identifies a massive ghost project—a dam that was paid for but never built. The OAG builds a case and hands it to the EACC and the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).  
* **The Chain of Events:** The case goes to court. The prosecution presents the satellite change detection charts as the primary evidence of non-existence. The Defense Counsel objects, citing Section 106B. "Who operated this satellite? Where is the certificate? This is inadmissible electronic hearsay generated by a foreign entity."  
* **The Outcome:** The Magistrate, bound by conservative interpretation of the Evidence Act and precedent (*Njenga vs Masitsa*), rules the satellite evidence inadmissible. The case collapses. The corrupt official walks free.  
* **The Specific Root Cause:** The lack of a clear legal framework or Practice Direction recognizing remote sensing data as "Official Records" exempt from the strict "operator certificate" requirement.

---

## **8\. Strategic Recommendations**

To navigate these kill chains and operationalize Oneka AI, the OAG must adopt a strategy that is 20% technology and 80% policy reform.

### **Recommendation 1: Policy Pre-Requisite (The "No GPS, No Tender" Rule)**

The OAG must leverage its influence to push for an immediate amendment to the **Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Regulations**.

* **Action:** Mandate that all Procuring Entities must upload a **KML/KMZ file** (Geospatial Polygon) of the project site to the PPIP at the time of Tender Advertisement.  
* **Mechanism:** Amend the Standard Tender Document to make the "Digital Site Visit Certificate" (with GPS stamp) a mandatory requirement for responsiveness.  
* **Goal:** Shift the burden of geolocation to the applicant. If the system doesn't know *where* it is, the money doesn't move.

### **Recommendation 2: The "Triangulation" Protocol**

Do not rely on Oneka AI as the sole source of truth. Use it as a **Risk Triangulation Engine**.

* **Action:** Integrate Oneka AI with IFMIS.  
* **Logic:**  
  * IFMIS says: "Payment Made."  
  * Oneka AI says: "No Change Detected (Red Flag)."  
  * **Result:** Do not auto-fail. Instead, trigger a **"Targeted Physical Audit."** Send the human auditor to *that specific site*.  
* **Goal:** This mitigates the "Resolution Risk" and the "Legal Risk" because the final evidence in court will be the *human auditor's report*, backed by the satellite intelligence that sent them there.

### **Recommendation 3: Legal "Sandbox" & Precedent Setting**

Do not wait for a crisis to test the law.

* **Action:** The OAG Legal Team should work with the Judiciary Training Institute (JTI) to educate judges on Remote Sensing evidence.  
* **Action:** Initiate a "Test Case" on a smaller, clear-cut stalled project. Present the satellite evidence with a robust Section 106B certificate signed by the OAG's Data Science Lead, arguing that the "computer" is the OAG's processing server. Secure a High Court ruling that establishes the admissibility of such data.  
* **Goal:** Create a binding legal precedent ("The Oneka Precedent") that validates the methodology before attacking high-profile corruption.

### **Recommendation 4: The "Public Eye" Partnership**

Recognize the limits of the OAG's capacity.

* **Action:** Publish the Oneka AI map to the public (redacting sensitive sites). Allow citizens to "Claim a Project." A citizen in Wajir can stand in front of the "Ghost Classroom" and upload a geotagged photo via a mobile app.  
* **Goal:** This provides the "Ground Truth" to validate the satellite model and engages the ultimate stakeholders—the Kenyan people—in the audit process.

Conclusion:  
Oneka AI is not a magic bullet; it is a precision instrument in a blunt environment. It faces significant friction from the analog legacy of land records and the rigid formalism of the legal system. However, the cost of the status quo—KES 304 Billion in stalled projects and a 3-month audit window that guarantees blindness—is unsustainable. By addressing the data "Kill Chains" proactively, the OAG can turn Oneka AI from a theoretical concept into the most fearsome tool for accountability in the history of the Republic.
