# The Oneka Protocol: Solving the "Ghost Project" Crisis

## 1. Problem Analysis (5W2H)

### **WHO is affected?**

- **The Primary Victim:** The Kenyan Taxpayer, who loses **KES 270–304 Billion** annually to projects that are paid for but never delivered.
- **The Auditor:** The Office of the Auditor General (OAG), which is constitutionally mandated to verify expenditure but is structurally incapacitated by a 1:1000 auditor-to-project ratio.
- **The Vulnerable:** Citizens in marginalized counties (e.g., Wajir, Turkana) who are denied essential services (maternal health, education) due to stalled public facilities.

### **WHAT is the problem?**

- **The "Audit Gap":** A systemic inability to verify the physical status of thousands of decentralized projects.
- **"Ghost Projects":** Contractors claim payments for "ghost" work—certifying completion stages (e.g., "slab complete") in financial reports while the physical site remains bare earth.
- **The Data Void:** A fundamental disconnect between financial intent (IFMIS data) and physical reality. Tender documents lack GPS coordinates, and payment systems generally do not require photographic proof of works.

### **WHERE does it happen?**

- **Nationwide:** Across all 47 Counties, but most acutely in:
  - **Remote/Arid Areas (ASALs):** Where physical inspection is logistically difficult and expensive (e.g., Turkana, Mandera).
  - **The "Cloud Belt" (Central Highlands):** Areas like Kiambu and Nyeri where persistent cloud cover blocks traditional optical satellite auditing for months at a time, providing cover for inactivity.

### **WHEN does it occur?**

- **During the Payment Cycle:** Specifically between the "Interim Payment Certificate" (IPC) issuance and the actual fund disbursement.
- **The "End of Year" Rush:** A spike in fraudulent claims often occurs in June (fiscal year-end) as departments rush to "absorb" budgets to avoid returning funds to Treasury.
- **Reporting Lag:** The Auditor General's report is typically released **18-24 months** after the funds have been stolen, making recovery nearly impossible.

### **WHY is it happening?**

- **Information Asymmetry:** The National Treasury releases funds based on paper certificates signed by local engineers, without independent means to verify if the concrete was actually poured.
- **Resource Constraints:** The OAG can physically sample less than **5%** of projects annually. Corruption thrives in the 95% shadow of un-audited projects.
- **Technological Limitation:** Reliance on optical satellites (Google Earth) fails in cloudy regions, and reliance on manual GPS collection fails due to human error/omission in tender documentation.

### **HOW is it executed?**

- **The Paper Trail Fraud:** Corrupt actors exploit the lack of interoperability. A tender is awarded under one name, paid under a generic vote head in IFMIS, and the facility is named differently in the Master Facility List. This deliberate obfuscation prevents auditors from "connecting the dots" between the money sent and the hole in the ground.
- **The Weather Excuse:** Contractors delay works claiming "bad weather," knowing that auditors cannot check site conditions remotely through the clouds.

### **HOW MUCH does it cost?**

- **Financial Impact:** Approximately **KES 304 Billion** is currently locked in stalled or stalled-and-delayed projects.
- **Opportunity Cost:** Saving just **1%** of this leakage equates to **KES 3 Billion** annually—enough to build 600 new Level 2 hospitals every year.

## 2. Unique Value Proposition (UVP)

Oneka AI is the **only** infrastructure audit platform that guarantees **100% visibility** regardless of weather or location.

### **Why Oneka AI?**

1.  **The "All-Seeing" Radar (SAR Technology):**
    Unlike competitors that rely on optical satellite imagery (which fails 60% of the time in Central Kenya due to clouds), Oneka utilizes **Synthetic Aperture Radar (Sentinel-1)**. We can "see" through clouds, rain, and smoke, ensuring that bad weather is never an excuse for a lack of data.

2.  **From "Random Sampling" to "Precision Targeting":**
    We do not aim to replace the human auditor; we give them "X-Ray Vision." Instead of visiting 5% of sites at random (a "needle in a haystack" approach), Oneka scans 100% of projects automatically and generates a **Risk Heat Map**. This allows the Auditor General to deploy field teams _only_ to the specific sites flagged as "High Risk," increasing the probability of fraud detection from <5% to >90%.

3.  **Automated Legal Admissibility (Section 106B):**
    We solve the "so what?" problem. Detecting fraud is useless if it doesn't stand up in court. Oneka AI is the first tool designed with the **Evidence Act** in mind, automatically generating a certified "Chain of Custody" certificate for every satellite image, transforming digital intelligence into admissible legal evidence for the EACC and DPP.

4.  **Zero-Entry Geolocation (The "Smart Ingest"):**
    We solve the "garbage in, garbage out" problem of missing GPS data. Our proprietary **Proxy Geolocation Engine** links vague tender descriptions (e.g., "Gituamba Dispensary") to official Government Gazette codes (MFL), instantly retrieving the correct GPS polygon without requiring the user to manually pin locations.
